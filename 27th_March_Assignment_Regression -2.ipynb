    "Q1. Explain the concept of R-squared in linear regression models. How is it calculated, and what does it\n",
    "represent?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "    R-squared (R2) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of variation in the dependent \n",
    "    variable that can be explained by the independent variable(s) in a linear regression model. It is a \n",
    "    measure of how well the linear regression model fits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is calculated by dividing the sum of squares of the regression (SSR) by the total sum of squares\n",
    "(SST):\n",
    "\n",
    "R2 = SSR/SST\n",
    "\n",
    "where SSR is the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values, and SST\n",
    "is the sum of the squared differences between the actual values and the mean value of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit of the model to the data. \n",
    "An R-squared value of 1 indicates that the model explains all the variation in the dependent variable, \n",
    "while an R-squared value of 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variation in the \n",
    "dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared has some limitations, and it should be used in conjunction with other metrics to evaluate the \n",
    "performance of a model. For example, R-squared does not indicate whether the independent variable(s) cause \n",
    "changes in the dependent variable, or whether other factors may be contributing to the relationship. \n",
    "Additionally, R-squared can be inflated by adding more variables to the model, even if those variables do\n",
    "not improve the model's predictive power. Therefore, it's important to use caution when interpreting \n",
    "R-squared values and to consider other factors such as the coefficients, residuals, and other goodness-of-fit\n",

    "Q2. Define adjusted R-squared and explain how it differs from the regular R-squared.\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "   Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of the regular R-squared that takes into account the number of\n",
    "    independent variables in the model. While R-squared measures the proportion of variation in the dependent\n",
    "    variable that is explained by the independent variable(s), adjusted R-squared penalizes for the addition\n",
    "    of irrelevant variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared = 1 - [(1 - R-squared) * (n - 1) / (n - k - 1)]\n",

    "regular R-squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjusted R-squared value ranges from 0 to 1, just like the regular R-squared value. However, the \n",
    "adjusted R-squared value is always lower than the regular R-squared value when there are multiple \n",
    "independent variables in the model. This is because the adjusted R-squared value penalizes for adding \n",
    "irrelevant variables to the model, while the regular R-squared value does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a higher adjusted R-squared value indicates a better fit of the model to the data, because it \n",
    "indicates that the independent variables in the model are more relevant to explaining the variation in the \n",

    "Q3. When is it more appropriate to use adjusted R-squared?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "   It is generally more appropriate to use adjusted R-squared when comparing models with different numbers of\n",
    "    independent variables, as it takes into account the number of independent variables in the model and \n",
    "    penalizes for adding irrelevant variables. This helps to avoid overfitting the model by including \n",
    "    unnecessary variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider two models with different numbers of independent variables: Model A with two \n",
    "independent variables and Model B with four independent variables. If the regular R-squared for both models\n",
    "is similar, we may be tempted to choose Model B because it has more independent variables. However, if we\n",
    "calculate the adjusted R-squared, we may find that Model A has a higher adjusted R-squared value, indicating\n",
    "that it is a better fit for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared can also be useful when performing stepwise regression, which involves adding or removing \n",
    "variables from the model to find the best fit. In this case, using adjusted R-squared helps to select the \n",
    "model that includes only the relevant variables, while penalizing for the addition of irrelevant variables.\n",

    "Ans-\n",
    "Lasso regularization, also known as L1 regularization, is a technique used in linear regression to prevent \n",

    "does. This means that Ridge regularization tends to produce models with more evenly distributed coefficient \n",

    "In general, Lasso regularization is more appropriate to use when the dataset has a large number of features \n",
